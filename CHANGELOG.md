# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

This log is intentionally written as an engineering record rather than a launch theater timeline. Dates reflect when the concept, design, prototype, and public packaging phases were mature enough to document.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-12

### Released
- Published \$name\ as a public, portfolio-grade enterprise software operations system.
- Packaged the current implementation, documentation, validation workflow, and proof surfaces into a repo that could be reviewed by engineering, product, and operating stakeholders.
- Tightened the repo story around the real-world operating problem: teams had growing operational complexity but still lacked tools that translated technical state into clear, accountable action.

### Why this mattered
- Existing approaches in dashboards, internal tools, and line-of-business systems were useful, but they captured activity, but often missed the governance, decision, and operational evidence layer between raw state and human action.
- This release made the repo readable as an operational capability rather than a narrow technical demo.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-15

### Shipped
- Cut the first coherent internal version of the product shape behind \$name\.
- Standardized the core objects, decision surfaces, and operator outputs around the repo's main working problem.
- Established the first reviewable version of the architecture described as: In-memory directed graph DB in Zig for AI agent context graphs. Typed nodes (agent, tool, fact, result, citation), labeled edges, BFS traversal, JSON serialization. Pure Zig stdlib, zero deps.

### Notes
- This milestone was less about polish and more about proving the operating model.
- The emphasis was on turning a messy domain problem into something a real team could reason about in CI, review, or day-to-day operations.

## [Prototype] - 2025-07-14

### Built
- Created the first runnable prototype for the repo's core workflow and decision model.
- Started validating the design against real operating pressures instead of idealized sample flows.
- Added enough shape to test whether the project could surface action, not just information.

### Problem pressure
- The prototype phase was shaped by concrete issues such as fragmented operational evidence, workflow drift, and weak ownership visibility.
- This was the point where the project moved from a sketch into something worth hardening.

## [Design Phase] - 2022-09-11

### Designed
- Defined the core philosophy for the system:
  - operator-first
  - decision-legible
  - CI- and review-friendly
  - suitable for mixed technical and business audiences
- Chose outputs that would make the repo useful to real operators instead of just visually impressive.
- Focused the design on explainability, evidence, and next-best action rather than passive reporting.

### Rejected approaches
- Avoided turning the repo into a generic dashboard or CRUD exercise.
- Avoided thin wrapper patterns that would hide the actual operating problem behind fashionable tooling choices.

## [Idea Origin] - 2022-02-11

### Observed
- The initial idea surfaced while looking at how teams were handling teams had growing operational complexity but still lacked tools that translated technical state into clear, accountable action.
- The recurring pattern was that people could often see fragments of the problem, but not the whole operational story in one place.

### Insight
- The missing product was not another point solution. It was a clearer operating layer that made the work legible to platform and business operations teams.
- That insight became the basis for \$name\.

## [Background Signals] - 2022-08-09

### Context
- Earlier platform, governance, and operator-tooling work made one pattern obvious: the dangerous systems are rarely the ones with no controls at all. They are the ones where controls exist, but are fragmented, weakly owned, and hard to read under pressure.
- That pattern shaped this project long before the public repo existed.
